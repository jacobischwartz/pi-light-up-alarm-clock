**Light Up Alarm Clock**

This project is the controller for a home grown alarm clock.
The clock will be built using a Raspberry Pi for the controller and web interface, 
and an arduino to implement the alarm action.
The alarm clock will gradually light up the room.
This controller will allow different alarm times to be set for each day of the week.
